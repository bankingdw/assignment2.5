1. Explain what is a cluster and what is a hadoop cluster
cluster
a group of similar things or people positioned or occurring closely together.
Hadoop cluster

* Data Storage has grown exponentially in the recent past,
 but data reading speed has not improved radically
*A Hadoop cluster is a special type of computational cluster 
designed specifically for storing and analyzing huge amounts 
of unstructured data in a distributed computing environment. 
*Hadoop clusters are known for boosting the speed of data analysis
 applications. They also are highly scalable.
* If a cluster's processing power is overwhelmed by growing volumes
 of data, additional cluster nodes can be added to increase throughput.
* Hadoop clusters also are highly resistant to failure because each piece 
of data is copied onto other cluster nodes, which ensures that the data is 
not lost if one node fails.

2. Explain the components of Hadoop 1.x

NameNode
• Contains the Hadoop FileSystem Tree and other metadata information about files and
directories
• Contains in-memory mapping of which blocks are stored in which datanode

Secondary Namenode
• Performs house-keeping activities for NameNode, like periodic merging of namespace and
edits
• This is not a back up for NameNode

DataNode
• Stores actual data blocks of file in HDFS on its own local disk
• Sends signals to NameNode periodically (called as Heartbeat) to verify if it is active
• Sends block reporting to the NameNode on cluster startup as well as periodically at
every 10th Heartbeat
• The DataNode are the workhorse of the system
• They perform all the block operations, including periodic the Checksum. They receive
instructions from the NameNode of where to put the blocks and how to put the blocks

JobTracker (Not present in Hadoop 2.x)
• Controls overall execution of map reduce jobs

TaskTracker (Not present in Hadoop 2.x)
• Runs individual map-reduce jobs on DataNodes
• Periodically communicates with the JobTracker to give updates and receive instructions
